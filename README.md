- After nearly 16 months with our Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR+), I decided to create a full summary video running through everything I could think to note from the time of buying the car until today. Watch the video for the full summary. Below the video is a bullet-point list of some highlights.


- The ordering process is the easiest, quickest ordering (including financing) process imaginable for a car. It’s stunningly easy, quick, and painless.
- The delivery process was also quite quick and easy.
- A few days after receiving the car, I wrote an article titled, All The Problems With Our New Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus. I recommend you check it out if you missed that.
- We’ve had a couple of minor trim issues — well, one was just imagined and one real (and extremely minor). Frankly, even on the second one, if I hadn’t been so aware of such issues from all the FUD about them, I might not have ever noticed and I definitely wouldn’t have thought to have it fixed by the service center. (Side note: I didn’t realize it was going to cost me
- Additionally, the white seats are a luxurious feature I still notice and appreciate on a regular basis. They are so super duper soft, and they also look beautiful from outside the car looking in on many instances — at night in the moonlight for example. I am a big fan of the white & black contrast in the interior as well.
- Overall, I think the Model 3 is indeed the best car in the world. Seriously. The only passenger vehicle I think is a step up is the Model Y crossover/SUV, which offers basically everything the Model 3 offers (except the lower sedan positioning and a slightly lower price) but also much more cargo space, more passenger space, and easier ingress and egress (and that higher positioning/view on the road if you prefer that).
